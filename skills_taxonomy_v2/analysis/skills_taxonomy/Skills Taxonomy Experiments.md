# Building a Skills Taxonomy

Experimentation with building a skills taxonomy is done in the relevant notebooks in `skills_taxonomy_v2/analysis/skills_taxonomy/notebooks/`.

The previous step in the pipeline was extracting the skills from TextKernel data. From a first pass at this on a sample of 207,303 sentences we have 4573 skills from 41,508 job adverts. Note that this is a small subsection of all the job adverts, but we hope it serves as enough to build a first pass of the taxonomy from.
