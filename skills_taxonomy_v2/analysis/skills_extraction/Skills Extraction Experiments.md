Functions to clean sentences to reduce them to the main words to do with skills can be found in `skills_taxonomy_v2/pipeline/skills_extraction/cleaning_sentences.py`.

Experimentation with 4 approaches is done in the relevant notebooks in `skills_taxonomy_v2/analysis/skills_extraction/notebooks/`:
1. Network approach
2. Transformers sentence embeddings approach
3. Word2vec approach
4. Tranformers word embeddings approach

More details to follow.
