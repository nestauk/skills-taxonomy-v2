# Sentence Classifier

There are three main scripts for the scaled up Sentence Classifier:

1. `sentence_classifier.py` - module for the BertVectorizer class the updated SentenceClassifier class
2. `predict_sentence_class.py` - make predictions using the sentence classifier on an input file of data
3. `utils.py` - preprocessing steps for sentences, splitting sentences, verb features

As the training data labels aren't perfect, I would take the classification report with a slight pinch of salt. Qualitatively, after looking at sentences that the model labelled 0 but was manually labelled 1, it appears that the most recent classifier pipeline does a worse job of picking up sentences that are labelled 'skill' sentences that appear to contain a 'characteristic' as opposed to a skill i.e.:

- 'we are looking for an ethusiastic, talented individual to join the team'
- 'if you can offer us some flexibility to help us cover peak times such as back to school all the better'
- 'there are many reasons why people become care assistants but the main motivation is the chance to make a difference'
- 'number about the role are you a paediatric healthcare assistant looking to join an exceptional team of people'

where (presumably) someone labelled this as a skill sentence for 'enthusiastic', 'fexibility', '(wanting to)make a difference' etc.

### Sentence classifier - `2021.08.06.yaml`

This config includes training data where additional cleaning was done. This allowed better splitting of sentences and so there is more of it. This training data file is `outputs/sentence_classifier/data/training_data_April2021_08_06_21.json`. Uses my own method for getting the last BERT embedding layer from 'bert-base-uncased'. This uses seed 4.

## Predicting

Running

```
python skills_taxonomy_v2/pipeline/sentence_classifier/predict_sentence_class.py --config_path 'skills_taxonomy_v2/config/predict_skill_sentences/2021.08.16.local.sample.yaml'
```

with the most recent config file will take in job adverts, split them into sentences, and make predictions using a trained skill sentence classifier model (`model_config_name`). The output will be filtered to only include skill sentences. The config file can specify that the data to be predicted on comes from S3 or locally (`data_local`), and it can be a directory of files to predict on or just one file (`input_dir+data_dir`). The outputted file(s) will be in the same folder structure as the inputs and contain one json in the form of:

```
{'job_id_1': [('sentence1'), ('sentence2')], 'job_id_2': [('sentence1'), ('sentence2'}
```

To predict on all job adverts in the TextKernel data on S3, on the EC2 instance I ran

```
python skills_taxonomy_v2/pipeline/sentence_classifier/predict_sentence_class.py --config_path 'skills_taxonomy_v2/config/predict_skill_sentences/2021.08.16.yaml'
```

### From `2021.07.09.yaml`:

This will run predictions on a random sample of 10 of the 686 data files. The outputs of this yielded 5,823,903 skill sentences from the 1,000,000 job adverts.

### From `2021.08.16.yaml`:

This will run predictions on a random sample of 100 of the 686 data files. Only the first 10,000 job adverts from each file were processed due to memory issues.

The skill sentences predicted are stored in "outputs/sentence_classifier/data/skill_sentences/2021.08.16/textkernel-files/", only 87 files were found, suggesting that 13 from the sample of 100 didn't have any skill sentences in for one reason or another.

In each of the 87 files around 45,000 skill sentences were identified, thus we expect to have processed around 4,000,000 skill sentences.
